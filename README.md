Profile algorithm is to draw a maximal profile of all VRTs, which is not only for storage polymerization, but also a preparation of lookup and update polymerization.

TSP is a simulator for DHGS algorithm presented in C.1, which is a suboptimal algorithm with the time complexity of O(mn2).Furtherly, we add two preprocessing operations to reduce the complexity to O(n2) in the worst case.

Bitmap is a program to generate the 01 bitmap and count the number of 1's in the map, which provides support to our research.

BitCount is a program to describe the Counting 1's algorithm memtioned in C.2 in our paper.
